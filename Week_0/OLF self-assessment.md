## OLF self-assessment
Considering current practices & next steps

## Background
Open leadership is a set of principles, practices, and skills people can use to mobilize their communities to solve shared problems and achieve shared goals.

Open leaders design, build and empower projects and communities for understanding, sharing, and participation and inclusion.

### Completing this self-assessment will help you discover how often you take those principles and practices into account as your practice open leadership in the projects and communities you serve. You can then focus on learning and practising the skills that will improve your practice.


## Story

#### Hector, the open evangelist

#### Before
Hector is an evangelist for openness working at a media policy non-profit. A colleague emails him a link they found to the Open Leadership Framework. Hector spends an afternoon reviewing and critiquing the framework and then imagines ways he might adapt and apply its principles, practices, and skills in his own work and in his organization.
#### Use-case
Hector tries the self-assessment use-case to see how well his beliefs and practices align with the framework and to identify areas of personal and professional development he might pursue as a self-identified open leader. He finds that while he often designs and builds projects for open participation, he doesn’t empower others to take on leadership roles in his projects as much as he thought he did.
#### After
Through a follow-up conversation with members of Mozilla’s Open Leadership & Events team, Hector learns about the MIT Open Leadership Camp and attends the next round with his director to learn how they might better delegate leadership of their organization’s projects to volunteer contributors. They leave camp with a new system to test for identifying volunteer contributors ready to take on project management roles.

### Interpreting your empower score
* If you scored 9 or below, empower might be an area of growth for you. Consider applying for our next Open Leaders cohort for mentoring.
* If you scored between 10 and 13, there might be specific parts of your empower practice you’d like to improve. Consider bringing a project to our next Global     Sprint to practice and get community feedback.
* If you scored 14 or above, empower might be an open leadership strength for you. Consider sharing your practices and projects with others through events like     MozFest.

### Interpreting your overall score
Developing your open leadership practice is a journey, and the most important step you can take on that journey is to begin in an intentional way. You should use your overall score as motivation to explore and learn about the areas of open leadership that seem most interesting and important to you. 

What do you want to accomplish with your work? Where do you need to grow the most to do that? What principles, practices, and skills do you need to adopt to become more open, even if your core leadership practice is already sound?

Use your score intentionally to set a course for learning and growth. Be open-by-design in your leadership, rather than open-by-default. Make specific choices about how to improve and help your community to avoid overwhelming yourself or your contributors by trying to do everything open all at once.

* If you scored 36 or below, you might benefit from broad, general mentoring in open leadership. Consider applying for our next Open Leaders cohort.
* If you scored between  d 54, there might be specific areas of open leadership in which you’d like to improve. Consider bringing a project to our next Global     Sprint to practice and get community feedback.
* If you scored 55 or above, you might already have a strong personal open leadership practice. Consider sharing your methods and projects with others through     events like MozFest.
