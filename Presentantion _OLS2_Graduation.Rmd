Habitat loss derived from land use change, particularly land conversion into agriculture, is still among the greatest threats to biodiversity

Mapping the Land-Use Land-Cover (LULC) changes through time is, therefore, important and desirable to predict these threats and propose effective conservation policies (Jetz,Wilcove, Dobson, 2007).

LULC is also an important predictor of species’ occurrence and, thus extensively used in several ecological studies (Vigl, Tasser, Schirpke, Tappeiner, 2017).
